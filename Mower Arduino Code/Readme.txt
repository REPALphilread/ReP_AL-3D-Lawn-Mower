Features of 5.8
---------------

- Test sketches intgrated into the main program.  Choose Tests on the menu options and select the test
- Rain sensor added - turn on and off in the settings
- Improved Serial communication between the NANO and the MEGA.
- Reverse motors option removed. You need to get the cables correct. Its too complicasted to cater for all cabling variations
