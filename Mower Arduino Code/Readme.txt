----------------------------------

Code V6.03   
------------------------------

Upload the MEGA code to the Arduino MEGA
Upload the Nano code to the Arduino Nano
Upload the NodeMCU code to the NodeMCU Board


Features of 6.03
----------------

- Improved docking logic
- Docking can now be cancelled with the APP by pressing pause.
- Compass now uses degrees instead of heading for heading lock motion (better stability)
- Max_Cycle_Wire_Find set this for the maximum amount of cycles the mower moves forward to find the wire before reseting.
